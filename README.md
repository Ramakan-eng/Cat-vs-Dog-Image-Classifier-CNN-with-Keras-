# Cat-vs-Dog-Image-Classifier-CNN-with-Keras-
This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using  TensorFlow and Keras to classify images of cats and dogs .Project Highlights  - Preprocessing with `ImageDataGenerator` (rescaling, augmentation) - CNN architecture: `Conv2D`, `MaxPooling2D`, `Flatten`, `Dense` - Trained using `.fit()` and evaluated with validation data
